/**
 * FILENAME: complex_code_example.js
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This code is an example of a complex and sophisticated JavaScript program. It demonstrates various advanced
 * concepts and techniques, including object-oriented programming, recursion, closures, design patterns, and more.
 * 
 * The program simulates a simple e-commerce system with functionality for managing products, orders, and customers.
 * It uses classes, inheritance, async/await, arrow functions, and other modern JavaScript features to provide a
 * comprehensive and professional solution.
